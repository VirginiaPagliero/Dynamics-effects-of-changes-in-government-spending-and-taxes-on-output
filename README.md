 Replication of the paper by Olivier Blanchard and Roberto Perotti (2002) 'An empirical characterization of the dynamic effects of changes in government spending and taxes on output'

This paper examines the impact of fiscal policy adjustments, particularly deficit management, on economic variables. It highlights how empirical responses to fiscal shocks often diverge from traditional Keynesian and Neoclassical theories, with government spending and tax changes affecting GDP, private consumption, and investment differently. The study builds on Blanchard & Perotti (2002), incorporating cointegration techniques to account for long-term relationships among macroeconomic variables. Results suggest that while findings without cointegration align with existing literature, introducing cointegration leads to more persistent economic effects. The paper also addresses potential biases in impulse response functions due to omitted feedback from debt levels, as suggested by Favero & Giavazzi (2007).

The project was conducted in collaboration with Federico Bertoia.
